### Introduction

Semantic segmentation refers to the process of linking each pixel in an image to a class label. These labels could include a person, car, flower, piece of furniture, etc., just to mention a few. Semantic segmentation is very crucial in self-driving cars and robotics because it is important for the models to understand the context in the environment in which they're operating.
